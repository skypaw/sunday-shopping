## sunday-shopping ðŸ“…

#### Background:

Couple years ago there was change in Polish law, and you can no longer go shopping in every sunday.

#### Idea:

Idea for this project came to me when I wanted to check whether I can buy some groceries on sunday and all I've found
were articles from newspaper writing about everything and I couldn't find the answer for my question in the stack of ads
and other topics.

#### About:

 - First iteration - static webpage with js on client side calculating dates and comparing with hardcoded array
 - Second iteration - static webpage generated daily by Github Actions, jekyll and python
